I have created a hospital website that is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website's interface is professional but easy to use. I created five pages for this website: Home, About Us, Mail, Get in Touch, and Gallery. The Microsoft Azure Bot is also integrated into the website, which makes it more user-friendly and appealing to patients. Through this website, patients will be able to communicate with hospital staff directly and benefit from the ability to remain in the comfort of their own homes. There are numerous sections and features on the website, including mail sections and gallery sections. Overall, the website's user interface (UI) is very user-friendly and appealing to patients. This website's main goal is to give users an easy way to access healthcare services. The technologies that make this website easier to use and interact with include the bot service offered by Microsoft Azure. There are numerous sections that offer information about the hospital and its services to patients and other visitors.
